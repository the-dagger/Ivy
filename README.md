# Ivy
A personal assistant powered by IBM Watson Conversation Service
Ivy is a virtual assistant you can see.<br>
======
You can talk to her as though she is a real person and she will interact with you.<br>
You can ask her about information such as weather, stocks, flight information and sports scores. <br>
As an added bonus, she can send the data you ask her right to your phone so you are always notified.

Ivy is powered by IBM Watson to handle conversations and artificial intelligence. We taught her a bunch of things and she picked it up using machine learning.<br> The web app was built using Node.js, Ember.js HTML, and CSS. <br>We also used the Twilio API to handle mobile notifications.<br> Ivy was hosted and deployed using Bluemix.

The actual hologram is displayed using a clear prism that we built, placed atop a screen running the web app.
